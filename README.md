# AES-128

## Description

This program is ***a simple implementation of the AES-128 algorithm*** using c (~~although the files are stored in cpp~~).
The header file functions as declaration for functions in AES_128_v_1_0.cpp file. Also the substitution boxes are stored in the header file. All functions for encryption and decryption are stored in AES_128_v_1_0.cpp. Main.cpp is a simple function for testing.
The files should be well-annotated..
